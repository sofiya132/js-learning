# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository contains my JavaScript learning exercises.  
I will be learning and practicing foundational concepts, object-oriented programming, DOM/BOM manipulation, advanced JS, and later backend with Node.js and React.

## How I Use This Repo
- Each folder will contain `.js` practice files  
- Commit messages will explain what I learned each day
